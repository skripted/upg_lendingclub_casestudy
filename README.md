## Problem Statement

Loan data is provided to you containing the details of the loans issued from 2007 to 2011. The company wants to understand teh driving factors behind loan default. Variables that are strong indicators of default.

## Analysis

Multiple variables include term, type of loan, revolving credit utilization, debt-to-income ratio, loan amount, interest rates, grading system have been analyzed and interesting insights realized from the analysis.

1. Past Delinquencies are not a factor in the LC grading system - that should change
2. DTI and loan amount do not have the right correlation. Higher DTI should not result in higher loan amounts. 
3. Interest Rates are not applied with all risk factors taken into account
4. Revolving Credit Utilization again is not taken into account when approving higher loan amounts.
